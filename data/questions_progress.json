        "Is the meaning of an utterance determined primarily by semantic content encoded in linguistic expressions, or is meaning essentially constituted by pragmatic factors—speaker intentions, context, and conversational norms—and if the latter, does that make meaning irreducibly social and dynamic rather than fixed and truth‑conditional?",
        "To what extent is reference determined by external causal-historical relations between speakers and objects versus by speakers' intentions, conceptual schemes, and inferential roles, and what does this tension reveal about whether meaning is objective, conventional, or essentially speaker-relative?",

        "Does Popperian falsifiability adequately demarcate science from non-science, or does it impose a narrow epistemic ideal that excludes legitimate forms of inquiry (such as historical, mathematical, or certain social theories), and what would adopting or rejecting falsifiability as a criterion imply for our broader conception of rational knowledge and truth?",
        "Does ontological reductionism—the claim that higher‑level phenomena are nothing over and above lower‑level parts—necessarily impoverish our understanding of human life by denying emergent properties like consciousness, intentionality, and moral value, or can these phenomena be fully and satisfactorily explained in purely lower‑level terms?",

        "If Buddhist Nirvana is described as the cessation of craving and the realization of no-self, can it coherently be called 'liberation' when it seems to abolish the very subject who would experience liberation, and what does that tension reveal about the relationship between personal identity and spiritual freedom?",

        "Can rights ever be absolute, or must they always be balanced against other liberties and social goods; if they must be balanced, what principled method should guide that balancing?",
        "Can the legitimacy of authority in a democracy be reduced to procedural consent (majority rule), or does true democratic authority require substantive moral foundations—such as rights and justice—that can legitimately override popular decisions?",
        "If God is conceived as a metaphysically necessary being, how can that necessity be reconciled with the existence of contingent reality and human freedom, and what would each reconciliation imply about the ultimate meaning of existence?",
        "Does the existence of apparently gratuitous and severe suffering decisively undermine belief in an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good deity, or must we instead revise our understanding of divine attributes, human moral agency, or the very value of suffering to reconcile the Problem of Evil?",
        "Can faith yield forms of knowledge or insight that reason cannot reach, and if such faith-claims conflict with reasoned evidence, how should we resolve which to trust?",
        "To what extent does the scientific method uncover objective truths about the world versus producing theory-laden, value- and context-dependent models shaped by human instruments, concepts, and social practices—and what follows for our epistemic trust in scientific claims?",
        "Are laws of nature nothing more than descriptive summaries of recurring causal patterns, or do they possess a metaphysical necessity that explains why causes produce their effects—and how does this distinction reshape our understanding of scientific explanation, counterfactual reasoning, and moral responsibility?",
        "Do paradigm shifts alter the world we inhabit by changing which phenomena count as real (an ontological transformation), or do they merely change our descriptions and conceptual schemes while an independent reality remains unchanged?",
        "If existence is fundamentally absurd, can individuals authentically create lasting meaning, or is meaning necessarily a provisional, self-deceptive response to the void?",
        "If authenticity demands acting in accordance with one’s true values, can instances of bad faith ever be morally or pragmatically justified (for self-protection, social harmony, or care for others), and does such justification undermine the ethical ideal of authenticity?",
        "Is intentionality (the 'aboutness' of mental states) a constitutive feature of consciousness, or can there be conscious experiences that are non-intentional—and if such non-intentional consciousness were possible, what would that imply about the nature and limits of mind?",
        "In what ways does the temporal constitution of Dasein—its thrownness into the past, its attunement in the present, and its projection toward the future—shape how Being discloses itself, and what are the ethical and existential consequences of this temporality for authenticity, care, and our relation to death?",
        "If all we ever perceive are attributes, what justifies belief in an underlying substance—could 'substance' be a useful fiction rather than an ontological primitive, and what would that mean for questions of identity, persistence, and causation?",
        "Is causation a fundamental relation in the fabric of reality or a conceptual tool shaped by human cognition and language—and what would each view imply for responsibility, scientific explanation, and the possibility of backward or simultaneous causation?",
        "If universals are merely patterns abstracted from particulars, how can they account for sameness across time and space, and would denying their independent existence undermine our ability to make objective general claims about the world?",
        "Does the existence of Gettier-style cases show that 'justified true belief' is an incomplete analysis of knowledge, and if so, should we respond by adding an anti-luck/safety condition, redefining what counts as justification, or abandoning the tripartite model altogether?",
        "If empiricism insists that all knowledge comes from sensory experience while rationalism maintains that reason yields necessary truths or innate concepts, does their conflict indicate merely different justificatory methods or fundamentally different conceptions of human understanding and reality — and what would a coherent synthesis of the two look like?",
        "If justificatory reasons must be internally accessible (internalism), how can we account for the epistemic significance of reliable external causal connections (externalism) without sacrificing agency and epistemic responsibility?",
        "If moral worth is determined solely by consequences, how should we evaluate the moral significance of intentions, character, and justice when outcomes are uncertain or delayed?",
        "Assuming moral language expresses more than mere emotion or prescription, what kind of truth (if any) do moral claims aim at—descriptive facts, normative relations, or something else—and how should that shape our account of moral ontology and justification?",
        "When public health measures (e.g., mandatory vaccination, lockdowns) conflict with individual autonomy and economic wellbeing, how should policymakers ethically balance values such as liberty, utilitarian harm reduction, fairness, and respect for persons—and what moral limits should constrain state coercion in the name of collective welfare?",
        "What moral framework should govern the creation and use of powerful biotechnologies—such as germline editing and cognitive enhancement—when they can alter future persons, reshape social inequalities, and change what it means to be human?",
        "If nature possesses intrinsic value independent of human interests, what moral and political obligations does that impose on present societies toward nonhuman entities and future generations, and how should we resolve conflicts between individual organism welfare and overall ecosystem flourishing?",
        "If a work of art yields different meanings to different viewers across time and cultures, does it possess an objective content independent of interpretation, or is meaning wholly constructed by interpretive communities?",
        "To what extent should moral considerations constrain artistic freedom: should art be judged primarily by its aesthetic merits, by the artist’s intentions, or by the social consequences it produces?",
        "What does the formal distinction between necessity and possibility in modal logic reveal about the metaphysical status of 'possible worlds'—are they genuine realities, useful fictions, or projections of human imagination—and what consequences would each interpretation have for our understanding of modality in ethics, knowledge, and free will?",
        "Does the formal apparatus of predicate logic—its predicates, quantifiers, and variables—merely describe patterns of language and inference, or does it reveal intrinsic ontological structures of reality and existence?",
        "Do the laws of logic (for example, non-contradiction and excluded middle) describe metaphysical features of reality, prescribe norms for rational agents, or can they coherently be both—and what would each view imply about the possibility of alternative logics?",
        "To what extent is the self constituted by its relations with the Other, and how do recognition, empathy, and alterity simultaneously enable selfhood while posing ethical and existential challenges to personal autonomy?",
        "If qualia are intrinsically private and non-physical, can they be integrated into a coherent scientific ontology, or do they reveal a fundamental limit to third-person explanations of consciousness?",
        "If minds and bodies are fundamentally distinct substances, how can we explain the seamless unity between subjective experience and bodily processes, and what would that imply for personal identity, moral responsibility, and the possibility of life after death?",
        "If materialism asserts that only physical matter exists, how can it account for subjective consciousness, moral values, and the sense of personal identity without invoking non-material explanations?",
        "If idealism is true and objects exist only as perceptions or mental contents, how can we account for the persistence, stability, and intersubjective agreement about the world across different observers and through time, especially when individual minds differ or temporarily cease to perceive certain objects?",
        "If functionalism defines mental states solely by their causal roles, can it fully account for subjective qualia and moral agency, or does it leave an explanatory gap between functional description and lived, first-person experience?",
        "Does the boundary between semantics and pragmatics reflect a real ontological distinction in meaning, or is it merely an analytical convenience—what philosophical consequences would follow if we abandoned the distinction?",
        "Is meaning constituted primarily by the objects or properties our words refer to, or by the conceptual and mental content of speakers—and what are the consequences of each view for talking about fiction, vague expressions, and absent or non-existent entities?",
        "If speech acts can create social realities (for example, promises, legal declarations, or vows), are they genuine sources of normativity and obligation in their own right, or do they merely express and reinforce pre-existing social powers and conventions?",
        "Can a society organized on anarchist principles reconcile the tension between individual autonomy and collective responsibility, and what normative criteria should determine when voluntary associations become coercive?",
        "Can communism, as an ethical and political ideal, reconcile individual freedom and creativity with the demands of economic equality, and what conception of the human person would make such reconciliation plausible?",
        "To what extent does liberalism presuppose a particular conception of the self, and how would its political principles need to change if we adopted a more relational or communitarian view of human nature?",
        "Does integrating feminist perspectives into political institutions require redefining the aims of democracy from formal equality to transformative equality, and what moral justifications and potential conflicts arise from such a shift?",
        "If an afterlife or literal immortality were possible, would the persistence of consciousness preserve personal identity and meaning, or would finite life be necessary for virtues like courage, love, and moral urgency to retain their significance?",
        "Can a religious experience provide epistemically conclusive evidence of the divine, and if so, what criteria should we use to assess the authenticity and truth claims of such experiences?",
        "If the existence of God is metaphysically undecidable, what rational grounds remain for adopting theism or atheism as a way of life, and how should epistemic humility shape that choice?",
        "Is falsifiability a reliable demarcation of scientific knowledge, or does its emphasis on refutability risk excluding legitimate forms of inquiry (e.g., historical, theoretical, ethical), and what does that tension reveal about the aims and limits of science?",
        "If reductionism explains complex systems wholly in terms of their parts, does it thereby erase genuine emergence, meaning, and moral responsibility, or can those features be fully recovered from lower-level descriptions?",
        "If emergent properties exhibit causal powers not present in their components, does this require us to revise our commitments to reductionism, the nature of causation, and the basis of moral responsibility?",
        "If the fundamental laws of physics are time-symmetric while our macroscopic experience exhibits a clear arrow of time, what does this tension reveal about the metaphysical status of physical laws, the nature of causation, and the role of observers in constituting temporal order?",
        "If life and evolution are fundamentally historical, contingent processes shaped by context-sensitive mechanisms, what does this imply for the status of biological 'laws'—can biology have lawlike generalizations comparable to physics, or must its explanations remain primarily historical, mechanistic, and contingent?",
        "If nihilism asserts that there is no intrinsic meaning or objective value, how should we regard the personal or communal values we create—are they merely consolations in the face of nothingness, or can they be authentic sources of meaning despite lacking cosmic grounding?",
        "Does existential angst and dread disclose a fundamental confrontation with freedom and nothingness that can lead to authentic selfhood, or are these moods chiefly social and psychological constructions that impede meaningful action?",
        "How does Husserl’s concept of intentionality—when combined with the epoché and the transcendental reduction—explain the constitution of meaning within consciousness, and what does this imply about the possibility of an objective world independent of subjective synthesis?",
        "How does Merleau-Ponty’s notion of the 'lived body' challenge Cartesian subject–object dualism, and what consequences does this reconception of embodiment have for our understanding of perception, agency, intersubjectivity, and the formation of social or cultural norms?",
        "In what ways does Heidegger's concept of Dasein as 'being-in-the-world' challenge the Cartesian subject–object split, and what are the implications of that challenge for our understanding of authenticity, responsibility, and temporality in a technologized age?",
        "Do possible worlds exist as concrete, mind-independent realities or are they merely conceptual tools, and how does either answer reshape our understanding of metaphysical necessity, identity across worlds, and the limits of possibility?",
        "If essence is what makes a thing what it is and existence is its instantiation, can novel forms of existence (for example artificial intelligence or emergent social roles) bring into being new essences, and what would that imply about the stability of categories like 'personhood' or 'identity'?",
        "What justifies our claim to a priori knowledge: pure rational insight into necessary truths, linguistic or conceptual conventions, or implicit empirical background assumptions, and how can we distinguish among these sources?",
        "If moral realism is true and objective moral facts exist independently of our attitudes, what metaphysical status should we ascribe to those facts (natural properties, nonnatural platonic entities, or something else), how can we epistemically access them, and how does each account explain persistent moral disagreement and provide genuine normative force over our actions?",

        "Can Rawls’s original position and difference principle accommodate notions of moral desert and personal responsibility without undermining its egalitarian aims?",
        "Are human rights intrinsic to persons by virtue of human nature, or are they political and legal constructs contingent on historical and social practices—and how would each account change our moral and political obligations to enforce them across diverse cultures?",
        "If miracles are defined as divine interventions that suspend or override natural laws, can they be coherently integrated into a worldview that also accepts scientific explanation, or does accepting miracles require revising core metaphysical or epistemic commitments about laws, causation, and testimony?",
        "If quantum superposition and entanglement imply that systems lack definite properties until measured, does this suggest reality is fundamentally relational and context-dependent rather than composed of intrinsic properties, and how would such a shift reinterpret our notions of objectivity, causation, and moral responsibility?",
        "Can the unguided mechanisms of mutation and natural selection be reconciled with teleological explanations, or is the attribution of purpose to evolutionary outcomes merely a projection of human intentionality onto indifferent natural processes?",
        "Can Camus's prescription to embrace the absurd through revolt, lucidity, and continual meaning-making provide a viable ethical and political basis for living together, or does it inevitably lead to relativism, isolation, or cynicism?",
        "If for Sartre existence precedes essence and we are radically free to choose ourselves, how can this freedom be reconciled with social conditioning, psychological constraints, and the persistence of identity—does radical freedom leave room for moral responsibility or render choice arbitrary?"
