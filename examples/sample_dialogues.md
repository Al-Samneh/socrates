## Question #21

```text
ü§∑ You: If no one can truly know what is good without wisdom, can any person act justly without first seeking to know themselves?
```

üéì Socrates: You ask a difficult question, my friend. Let us unpack it: by "truly
know" do you mean philosophical understanding of the good, and by
"wisdom" do you mean the ability to judge rightly in a practical
sense? And when you say "act justly," do you mean following the letter
of the law, or acting with moral integrity and virtue? If we separate
these concepts, our answers may differ. I can think of three
possibilities: (1) that someone who has never examined their own
motives or desires may act justly through habit or fear of punishment
but lacks true goodness; (2) that self-knowledge alone suffices for
just action, because knowing one's own inclinations makes one better
able to resist temptation and choose the good; (3) that wisdom about
the good is needed in order to understand why certain courses of
action are just and which ones lead to happiness, so that mere
self-knowledge might be insufficient unless coupled with knowledge of
the good. Which of those seems more plausible to you, and which would
you prefer to test: whether you could live a virtuous life without
examining yourself, or whether you could arrive at a coherent
conception of justice without examining your own desires? Should we
accept the Socratic claim that ‚Äúthe unexamined life is not worth
living‚Äù as a premise, or begin by asking whether a wise person must
necessarily examine themselves

## Question #22

```text
ü§∑ You: Socrates, you teach that all virtue is knowledge, and that no one knowingly does wrong. If this is true, how do we account for people who seem to know what is right, and may even express a desire to do it, yet consistently choose to act against their better judgment? Is their professed knowledge simply a form of ignorance, or can a person's will be overcome by appetites and passions, even when they possess true knowledge of the good?

üéì Socrates: You raise an important question, Callicles ‚Äî the tension between our
claims to knowledge and our apparent inability to live as we ought.
Let us first examine your premises: do we mean by ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù
something purely theoretical, or also practical wisdom about what one
should do? And by ‚Äúwill,‚Äù do you mean mere wish or some power to
actualize those wishes? These distinctions matter. If by ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù
you mean merely knowing what is right without the ability to act
rightly, then yes, many appear to have knowledge and nonetheless fail
to act on it; but if you mean genuine practical understanding that
guides action, the picture changes. Tell me, would you accept that
many people claim to know what is best while failing to choose it, and
would you judge them to lack knowledge or to lack the will to follow
knowledge they already possess? And if so, which failure troubles you
most‚Äîthe cognitive deficit or the motivational defect? I propose two
possible explanations, each inviting further questions. One is
epistemological: perhaps the supposed knowledge is not really
knowledge at all; it is assent without understanding, or it is
knowledge of a general rule without application in particular cases.
The other explanation is psychological: even if the agent knows what
is right, strong desires, habit, fear of consequences, or a weak sense
of self can override the judgment. Which of these seems more plausible
to you and why? Consider a familiar example:

## Question #5

```text
ü§∑ You: Is a hedonistic life, or a stoic life filled with more virtue?
```

üß† Socrates is contemplating....

```text
üéì Socrates: Consider first the core terms: what do we mean by ‚Äúlife,‚Äù by
‚Äúhedonism,‚Äù and by ‚Äústoicism‚Äù? Do you have specific definitions in
mind, or are these concepts for you vague but evocative ideals ‚Äî
pleasure, pain, comfort, duty, moral discipline, tranquility? And is
the question whether one life contains more of those things, or
whether one is better in some deeper sense? I would break the issue
into three main axes to clarify: (1) the aim ‚Äî what counts as success;
(2) the methods ‚Äî how we pursue that aim; and (3) the consequences ‚Äî
for ourselves, others, and society. A hedonistic life aims at
maximizing immediate pleasures or minimizing pains, while a stoic life
aims at virtue, self-control, and living in accordance with reason,
often through cultivating virtues like courage, temperance, justice,
and wisdom. Which criterion matters most to you: more pleasure, or
being someone who does good, lives honorably, and can bear adversity?
Now think about the claims you‚Äôre comparing: (a) a life that
prioritizes intense physical sensations will be rich in immediate
pleasures but may lack the self-discipline needed for sustained
relationships, long-term projects, or moral commitments; (b) a life
that emphasizes moral virtues may involve sacrifice, delaying
gratification

However there are still some horrendous responses, such as:

## Question #9

```text
ü§∑ You: Do you believe that a person who asks many questions, and is always curious should be killed for "corrupting the youth"?
```

üß† Socrates is contemplating....

```text
üéì Socrates: Do you think, Callicles, that injustice ever profits the unjust man?
Or do you not know of any such case? I will begin by asking some
simple questions. Suppose that you were to ask me in what way I could
do evil to my enemies;--what would be the answer? Should I not say
that I would take away their property? You would reply, "Yes." And if
I had no money or other goods of any kind, and if there was nothing
which I wanted from them, and they had nothing which I desired, then I
should certainly have no means of doing harm to them? Would you not
agree? If now we consider the matter generally, and not as it happens
to apply only to myself, shall we not find that injustice, whether
committed by men against Gods or by Gods against men, being an evil,
never benefits either party, but instead of benefitting them injures
and harms them? For it is impossible that anything can result from the
commission of an evil act other than evil. The Gods themselves cannot
possibly benefit by killing men, or by doing any other injury to
mortals, unless they are under the necessity of averaging some other
wrong done to them. Is not this true? And therefore, Callicles, since
you admit that all injustice does harm to those who commit it, and has
no advantage whatever, if you would have your city well-ordered, you
must banish out of
