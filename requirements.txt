# Requirements for the Socrates DPO Fine-tuning Project
# Pinned versions for critical libraries to ensure reproducibility,
# especially for bitsandbytes and the CUDA environment.
#
# To install, run:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Core ML/DL Framework and CUDA-related libraries
# Pinning these is crucial for bitsandbytes compatibility.
torch==2.8.0

# Hugging Face Ecosystem
# Pinning these ensures the APIs and integration points remain stable.
transformers==4.36.2
datasets==4.0.0
peft==0.7.1
trl==0.7.4
accelerate==0.25.0
# The bitsandbytes line from your pip freeze indicates a local install.
# If you have the .whl or source directory, you'll need that.
# If you installed from a repo, use that method. If from pip, pin the version.
# Assuming a standard pip install is desired for the next environment:
bitsandbytes==0.41.3 # A common version that works with this stack. Adjust if you know your specific version.

# Tokenizer library
sentencepiece==0.2.0

# General utilities
# Less critical to pin, but we will for maximum reproducibility.
requests==2.32.4
tqdm==4.67.1
